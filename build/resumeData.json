    "bio": "I am an entrepreneur with a passion for high-quality menswear, menswear education, and JavaScript Development. In the last ten years, I have dedicated myself to small business and local economic development. I work closely with other entrepreneurs, c-level executives, and senior leadership to create unique projects that bring brand awareness and generate revenue. Apart from being a full-time entrepreneur, I'm a husband and father to be living and working in San Antonio, Texas. I love music, menswear, business development, coffee, and a good cigar. When forced indoors, I follow whatever television shows my wife is watching, I am an aspiring product designer, and I spend my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the web + mobile development world. Lastly, I am optimistic and enjoy problem-solving at any level. I take pride in helping people find connections that add value to their aspirations, business, and lifestyle.",
